#Song generator


## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `song_generator.ipnyb`, originally developed as a part of a project for DSC10 at UCSD. The notebook showcases the application of data science principles to generate song lyrics using statistical models.

## Project Structure
- `song_generator.ipnyb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the song lyrics generator.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and presentations.

## Features
- **Lyric Generation**: Implementation of statistical models to generate song lyrics.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploration of song data to understand patterns in music lyrics.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots to visualize findings and model performance.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/song-generator-project.git
   ```
2. Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or install it via:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the `song_generator.ipnyb` file in Jupyter Notebook to view the project.

## Usage
Navigate through the notebook to understand the steps involved in data preprocessing, model building, and song generation. The notebook is well-commented to help guide you through the process.
